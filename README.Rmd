# What is a witness tree?

Any tree can be a witness tree by simply being enabled to witnesses life as a tree and its environment. To do this, a tree is enabled to "speak" for itself, using sensors and software that automatically translate data into easily interpretable messages for the general public in near-real-time. Strictly, speaking it is the data talking and not the tree.

# What is the witnessTree project?

The witness tree project is an open-source project that strives to provide the code and documentation to fit a simple monitoring system to any tree to become a witness tree. The original witness tree is based at Harvard Forest and its development was led by Tim Rademacher. Currently, the implementation focuses on twitter and facebook as distribution platforms for the generated content, but expansion to other social media is possible. 

# Why make a tree talk?

Trees are, in some ways, still the dominant form of life on earth and we want to give them a voice. We want to enable humans to understand the life experiences of trees first hand and how trees witness changes in their environment over their long lifetimes, that can stretch over several centuries. The original witness tree at Harvard Forest will additionally highlight some of the ongoing research on and around the tree with the aim to communicate the value of that science to a broader audience. Overall, the witness tree project attempts to inform and educate an interested public about the visible and invisible happenings in the forests around us.

# How does the tree talk?

The project is divided into several hardware and software components that are all undergoing active development and have been customized to a certain degree. Overall, necessities for a witness tree are, at least, one sensor, which transfer acquired data to a server that hosts the R and python scripts contained in <a href="https://github.com/TTRademacher/witnessTree">this github repository</a>.

The repository and code are openly available under the MIT license, which allows re-use. The repository is organised following a specific directory structure. The project folder contains a data/ folder containing the raw and processed data. The code folder contains the backbone of the application with R scripts being stored in the rScripts/ folder. These scripts analyse the data and create messages and figures. The R scripts are divided into various functions that are sources in the main script called witnessTree.R. The R functions also generate figures and store them as png-files in the figures/ folder. Additionally, stock photos as well as real-time camera images are stored in the images/ folder and can also be used in posts. Once all the functions have been run and messages have been generated, one message is selected depending on determined priority.

In a second step, the selected message with accompanying figures and images is passed to twitter by python scripts, which themselves are stored in the pythonScripts/ folder within the code/ folder. The python and R scripts are run regularly using a task scheduler, such as CRON on Unix-like operating systems, to generate, select and potentially post messages. 

The logs/ folder contains various log files 

In the posts/ folder copies of posted posts are saved. A file with posts, that were generate during previous iterations, but were not selected for posting is also created put into the posts/ folder. These posts are eventually recycled. During run-time the priority of each message is updated, and their expire date is checked to select the most appropriate messages and avoid posting posts at inopportune moments.

The config.example provides an example for necessary access tokens to connect to a twitter account. A copy of this file with updated account information needs to be saved as config in the code/ folder directory for the witness tree to work. 

Finally, a tmp/ folder exists for temporary storage of file, results, logs, etc.

# Who is the team behind the witnessTree?

Tim Rademacher is the project science lead, Clarisse Hart is the communications lead, and Taylor Jones is the engineering lead. Together Tim, Clarisse and Taylor work on developing the technology and making it more accessible, contributing to science education and outreach, and establishing new sites. David Basler, Shawna Greyeyes, and Kyle Wyche have contributed to the project with ideas, visuals, and code snippets. Tim developed the initial idea based on the <a href = "https://twitter.com/treewatchnet?lang=en">network of twittering trees from Europe</a> and the book "Witness Tree: Seasons of Change with a Century-Old Oak" by Lynda V. Mapes. For more information, you can write me an <a href = "mailto:trademacher@fas.harvard.edu">email</a>.
